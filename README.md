Hi, Iâ€™m Philipp.<br>
I'm an Austria-based student of Computer Science (with focus on &quot;<a href ="https://www.fhv.at/en/studies/engineering-technology/computerscience-digitalbusinessinnovationbsc/">Digital Innovation</a>&quot;) at <a href="https://www.fhv.at/en/">FH Vorarlberg</a>.<br>
Besides that, I'm currently working in Software Quality Assurance at <a href="https://www.servus.info/en/">Servus Intralogistics</a>.<br>
Although I'm currently not looking for any new opportunities, <a href="mailto:lossphilipp@gmail.com">my inbox is always open</a>. Whether you have a question or just want to say hi, I'll try my best to get back to you!
